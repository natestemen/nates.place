    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2020 I started a PhD program after 3 years of being outside a formal educational institution.
It felt like a big change in my life, and it prompted me to attempt blogging for the first time.
I had a feeling that the moment in time was one where significant change was coming, and I wanted to document some of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It coincided with the pandemic, and the practice fell into place with relative ease.
I still had to sit myself down and write, but there was a lot less stopping me when 50% of my normal life was put on hold.
Living in Vermont at the time the only people I interacted with were my parents, Diane, and the person who put groceries in the truck.
So much of &amp;quot;everyday-life&amp;quot; was culled, and as a result I found new ways to take up that space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing on a regular basis was going well.
Whether it was details about a topic I was studying, or difficulties navigating graduate school, the practice helped me process.
It was basically a version of a journal that I was willing to share publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also provided a record of what I was struggling with, which not only I could look back on, but also captured my naive understanding of concepts I was learning.
I try to capture early confusion not just because itâ€™s fun to document learning, but because when we teach others, we forget that clumsy feeling of misunderstand, and the associated misconceptions that come with it.
Even if I&#39;m not actively teaching a course, I believe a huge part of being a great friend/community member/coworker/partner is understanding where someone is coming from, and meeting them there (i.e. what good teachers do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One very real downside to writing in public is the excruciating cringe-factor that can come with documenting your learning.
Looking back on the posts I wrote during graduate school, it&#39;s hard to want to finish reading them sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I actually wrote that down for people on the internet to see?!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and while I strive to not embarrass myself too much, moderate embarrassment about previous understandings of the world isn&#39;t a crime.
I have to actively remind myself that asking dumb questions is okay, and being moderately ignorant online is a way to become less so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few months of consistently writing in grad school, my program got turned on its head with the departure of my advisor.
I stopped writing while scrambling to figure out what was next, and never picked the practice up again.
The dust has settled now (3 years later), and I feel that I am in a good place to start again.
I am learning a lot every day, and I want to share that with others.&lt;/p&gt;
