I love libraries.
Not just for the books, but it's one of the few [third places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) we have access to in the modern world.
So over the past two years, I visited all 27 branches of the [Seattle Public Library](https://www.spl.org/) system first and foremost just to see and experience them, but also to find new places to work remotely.

{% warning %}
  These are my opinions, and some ratings are based only on a single trip to a branch.
  My ratings of each branch are very much a function of my thoughts on trying to work there for anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours.
  Some branches are not necessarily designed with this use case in mind.
  **This is more fun than anything objective**.

## All the branches

- **Central Library**: Huge, beautiful. Go to 10th floor. 10/10
- **Ballard**: Nice space with good light and room to spread out, but kids screaming. 6/10
- **Beacon Hill**: Great, high ceilings and good lighting. 8/10
- **Broadview**: Spacious, lots of seating, good light. On a busy road though. 7/10
- **Capitol Hill**: Really cool building with some nice exposed brick and vines. Not a whole lot of seating though. 7/10
- **Columbia**: Nice space, but nothing to write home about. 6/10
- **Douglass-Truth**: I'm a bit biased here since this is the library closest to my house, but this branch is spacious and has great natural light. 8/10
- **Fremont**: A little small, but cool old building hidden in Fremont. 7/10
- **Greenwood**: Pretty standard good (but not great) library. 7/10
- **CID**: Very small, not a lot of room to work most days, great staff. 6/10
- **Madrona-Sally Goldmark**: Very small, but quiet. 6/10
- **Magnolia**: Great neighborhood, okay library. 6/10
- **Montlake**: Beautiful building, and great lighting. 9/10
- **NewHolly**: Small kids library in a kind of sad building (in comparison to others), but basically no one there. 5/10
- **Northeast**: Big space, pretty quiet, and good lighting. 8/10
- **Queen Anne**: Kinda busy, and not a lot of natural light. 5/10
- **Wallingford**: Small library; not really a place to work, but has all the resources you might need at a library. 4/10
- **West Seattle**: Nice, open concept with open windows. Spacious. 8/10
- **University**: Nice lighting, but not much space to work from. Kinda smells. 4/10
- **Lake City**: Big library with lots of space, but the desk seating is next to the bathrooms and not near windows. 6/10
- **Green Lake**: Really nice space with good natural light and brand new bathrooms. Not a ton of table space. 8/10
- **Northgate**: Nice high ceilings, but not a ton of desk space. 5/10
- **South Park**: Really quiet and good space. 8/10
- **Southwest**: Large, open space with good amount of tables. 8/10
