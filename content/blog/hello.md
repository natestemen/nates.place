In 2020 I started a PhD program after 3 years of being outside a formal educational institution.
It felt like a big change in my life, and it prompted me to attempt blogging for the first time.
I had a feeling that the moment in time was one where significant change was coming, and I wanted to document some of it.

Since it coincided with the pandemic, the practice fell into place with relative ease.
I still had to remind myself to sit down and come up with something to say, but there was a lot less getting in between me and writing than there is living in a post-lockdown world.
I was living in Vermont at the time, and the only people I interacted with were my parents, Diane, and the person who put groceries in the truck through our lockdown CSA.
So much of "everyday-life" was culled, and as a result I had more time to explore.

Writing on a regular basis was going well.
Whether it was details about a topic I was studying, or difficulties navigating graduate school, the practice helped me process.
It also provided a record of what I was struggling with, which

1. I could look back on, and
2. others could read, and perhaps sympathize with.

Starting graduate school during the pandemic meant that I had very little social interaction with my classmates.
So when I hit up against the academic bureaucracy machine, I didn't have someone to chat and vent to who was going through &mdash; or had experienced &mdash; something similar.
This type of situtation can be dangerous as abusive behavior is easily hidden.

Point 1 (something for me to look back on) has always been an ideal, but never a reality &mdash; the same thing happens with my old journals.
Perhaps 

Recording struggles is perhaps one of the greatest benefits of this type of writing, because it is very often the case that when learning something, once the struggle is passed, and the lesson is learned, it's extremely hard to remember that state of mind.
This, I'd argue, is a big problem for anyone who wishes to engage with other people.
With a firm understanding of a concept, idea, or theory, engaging with others without that understanding will go a lot better if you can remind yourself what was difficult about developing said understanding.
Now we are all different brains which process information differently, so there must be some limit to how much my understanding of something can help you understand it, but we're also all human.

One true, and very real downside to writing in public is the excruciating cringe-factor that can come with documenting your learning.
Looking back on the posts I wrote during graduate school, it's hard to want to finish reading them sometimes.
"I actually wrote that down for people on the internet to see?!"
Yes, and while I strive to not embarass myself too much, moderate embarassment about previous understandings of the world ~~is not~~ should not be so.
I have to actively remind myself that asking dumb questions is okay, and being moderately ignorant online is a way to become less so.

Back to grad school, after a few months of consistently writing, my program got turned on its head with the departure of my advisor.
I stopped writing while scrambling to figure out what was next, and never picked the practice up again.
The dust has settled now (3 years later), and I feel that I am in a good place to start again.
I am learning a lot every day, and I want to share that with others.
Whether that is through a blog post, or the meta-process of reflecting on previous struggles and distilling that insight into something new, I hope there is something for you.
