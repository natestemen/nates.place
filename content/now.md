## March 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

In the midst of planning an academic workshop on error mitigation ([werq.shop](https://werq.shop/)), which is both fun and nerve-wracking.
I hope people will come and enjoy it!

On the personal side, I'm rehabbing an A2 pulley injury from climbing, which is a bummer, but I'm still able to climb on the lighter side.
Recently went to Smith Rock for the first time and had a blast climbing some awesome multipitch routes.
Running training is going well.
Just building up mileage at the moment, and trying to stay injury free.

Lastly, I'm working through the perennial struggle that behooves anyone on the adhd spectrum: how to align my work and time with my values.

2024 was a bit of a doozy.
Trying to spend as much time as I can getting a big picture understanding of the larger field of quantum computation, while progressing smaller pieces (quantum error mitigation and circuit compilation).
Spending some time back in some academic circles at the University of Washington's [quantum group](https://quantum.cs.washington.edu/).

Training for climbing in hopes of redpointing 5.11b (sport) this year, and signed up to run my first ultramarathon in September.
Physically, it might be a bit too much to do both, but I'm aiming high.

Thinking about ways to grow and establish community.

## Feb 25<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Trying my best to stay active and engaged with people this winter.
The Seattle gray really sets in sometimes and me want to stay inside.
Climbing as much as I can, working hard at Unitary Fund, and also just started another pottery class!
Since I live on the computer a lot, it's nice to be able to play with mud regularly.

## March 20<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Trying my best to update this more regularly.
I've had a busy start to 2023 with proposing 💍 (and getting engaged) to Diane in January!
In February Diane and I bought a townhome 🏠 in Seattle.
And in March I met up with some friends to climb in red rocks and then ran 🏃 the LA
marathon!
Life feels quite hectic at the moment, and at times it has felt overwhelming.
But looking back on it, it's almost all with fondness.

## November 14<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Wow, it's been a while since updating here, but I'm not dead!
Ever since the PhD got cut short, life felt like it has been flying by.
Both in good, and bad, ways.
Things seems to have steadied a bit now, and Diane and I moved to Seattle which we are loving.
Been staying active and learning lots of new quantum things.
Work is good, exciting, and busy.
Encountering lots of new unknowns every day.

## January 7<sup>th</sup>, 2021
It's wild that it's 2021 and the year seems to be getting worse than 2020.
Anyway, I'm currently entering my second semester of grad school.
I'll be taking **Quantum Info. Devices** an **Open Quantum Systems** and maybe **Lie Groups/Algebras** if I decide taking three courses is manageable.
I've also been writing some poetry recently, along with some other creative writing.
I'd like to share some of it eventually, but not yet.

## August 18<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Currently breaking from work for about a month before I start classes in September.
Having fun doing tech stuff on my own, hanging out with family (where possible, pandemic is still happening ya know), chatting with friends, and cooking some food.

## June 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Currently working as a software developer at Overleaf where I write frontend, backend, do data analysis, go to conferences, go to london to hangout with the team, and have meetings.
It's a great gig and it pays well enough.
I work remotely (and not just because of the pandemic).
